**A next-generation framework to revolutionize Security Operations Centers (SOCs) by intelligently automating alert triage, reducing false positives, and eliminating log fatigue using LangGraph's multi-agent orchestration.**

## üåü Vision

Security Operations Centers are drowning in alerts. Analysts waste countless hours investigating false positives while critical threats get lost in the noise. LG-SOTF aims to transform SOC operations by:

- **Reducing alert fatigue** by 70%+ through intelligent automation
- **Slashing false positive rates** from 30-40% to under 15%
- **Cutting mean time to respond** from hours to minutes
- **Empowering analysts** to focus on genuine threats instead of noise

## üéØ Why This Project Matters

### The SOC Crisis
- **Alert Overload**: 10,000+ alerts per day in typical enterprises
- **False Positives**: 30-40% of alerts are false positives, wasting analyst time
- **Analyst Burnout**: 65% of SOC analysts report symptoms of burnout
- **Missed Threats**: Critical alerts get buried in the noise

### Our Solution
LG-SOTF leverages LangGraph's stateful multi-agent architecture to create an intelligent alert processing pipeline that:
1. **Automatically triages** alerts using rule-based and AI-powered analysis
2. **Enriches context** by correlating events across systems
3. **Performs deep analysis** using dynamic tool orchestration (ReAct pattern)
4. **Learns continuously** from human feedback to improve accuracy
5. **Escalates only high-value alerts** with full context to analysts
